# iCloud-Website-Clone-2019-
This was my very first project after learning HTML and CSS. I built a basic clone of the iCloud website to practice frontend development. Though initially lost due to a deleted GitHub account, I later re-uploaded it to reflect my early learning journey and show how my skills have grown since then.
