# iCloud-Website-Clone-2019-
This was my very first project after learning HTML and CSS. I built a basic clone of the iCloud website to practice frontend development. Though initially lost due to a deleted GitHub account, I later re-uploaded it to reflect my early learning journey and show how my skills have grown since then.<br>

### About Me 


#👋 Hey, I’m Lakshay Sharma

“The people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do.”– Steve Jobs

I'm a 19-year-old developer, dreamer, and builder, on a mission to transform ideas into reality through the power of code.

Whether it's a web interface, an app prototype, or an automation script — I believe every line of code I write brings me one step closer to shaping the future I imagine.

#🚀 Why I

Technology isn’t just about syntax or semicolons — it’s a canvas for creativity, a tool for impact, and a path to innovation.

If you’re looking for someone who is:

  💡 Endlessly curious and always learning
  ⚙ Obsessively driven by problem-solving and perfection
  🤝 Ready to collaborate on bold, meaningful projects

  You’re in the right place.

# 🛠 What I'm Building

This space is more than a portfolio — it's a living lab of my journey:

  🔗  Projects: Real-world experiments in progress (coming soon!)
  📓  Dev Logs: Notes, breakthroughs, and the messy magic of learning
  🌱  Growth: From first "Hello World" to a future in Robotics, AI & Automation

# 📬 Let’s Connect
